<h3> About Me </h3>
  <p> My name is Gintare Kreivyte. I was born on July 17, 1997 in Svencioneliai, Lithuania. I speak three languages: Lithuanian, Russian and English. I am an only child. My mom’s name is Svetlana Kreiviene and my dad’s name is Darius Kreivys. Growing up, I was very active and outgoing. I would spend my whole day outside with friends exploring. My favorite pastimes while growing up were painting and swimming. </p>
<h3> Moving to America </h3>
  <p> I learned that I was moving to Savannah, Georgia when I was 10 years old. I was not sure where that was. It seemed unreal to me. Lithuania was all that I knew, everyone and everything I loved was there. I also did not speak english, so moving was an extreme shock to me. It was almost like I had become deaf and blind. Everything was new to me. I became shy and closed off to my peers. The first year, I refused to learn English. I believed that if I did not learn, then we would move back to Lithuania. However that did not happen. I learned English pretty fast once I put my mind to it. I had some pretty great people to teach me. </p>
<h3> School</h3>
  <p> For one year, I went to Pooler Elementary. That was the year that I refused to learn english, so I do not really remember much from my year there. However, I started to attend Calvary Day School in 6th grade. It was there where I found some of my long life friends. The teachers really cared about me and helped me in any way possible. It was a really tight knit school. I graduated 12th grade from Calvary Day School in 2015. It was sad to leave behind all my teachers, but I knew that I could count on them even after I have left. </p>
<h3> University Life</h3>
  <p> Currently I attend University of Georgia. I am a second year student studying Economics. It was pretty rough going from a small private school to a huge university. I adapted quickly. I got involved in UGA Miracle and through that I have met some of my best friends. I live in an off-campus apartment with two other roomies. One of them has become of my best friends and sisters. She also has a Doberman named Bruce, who is the sweetest and at the same time spoiled little pup. I plan to graduate in the winter of 2018. I would love to study abroad in Amsterdam my third year of college, however, nothing has been decided yet. </p>
<h3> Adult Life</h3>
  <p> After I graduate, I would love to take a year off and be a flight attendant for airline SAS, or work at a cafe in Barcelona beach. Whether or not my one year off will happen, I plan on working in the logistics/export business. My dad owns a car export business and I have grown up around it. I would love to take over my dad’s business. My dad has done a great job expanding the company and has many yards all over America, however I hope to expand it even more. My second love is fashion, and I would love to have a side job as a stylist. I plan to life in Chicago or Miami, but I would also love to move back to Europe. I would love to have a small apartment in Vilnius, Lithuania as I go there every year.</p>
<h3> Goals</h3>
  <p> My one passion in life is to travel. I have been all over America as well as Europe. My favorite country I have visited so far is Italy. This summer (2017) I plan to travel to Russia, as I have not seen many of my family members ever since I was little. I am extremely interested in traveling Asia, especially Thailand and China. Hopefully in the years to come, I will have an opportunity to go there.</p>
